This repository demonstrates a common yet easily overlooked JavaScript bug involving type coercion.  The function `foo` intends to add two numbers, but because a string is provided as one argument, JavaScript performs string concatenation instead of numerical addition. The solution shows how to explicitly convert to numbers before addition or use a type-checking approach to prevent unexpected results.
